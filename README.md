# CS210-Final_Project Retrospective

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
 - Program needed to accept file input, count occurrences of words within that file, output a list of each word and their frequency to a file called "frequency.dat", then provide a continuous user menu. The user could then use the menu to search the list to retrieve the word's frequency, or print out a list of each word and their frequency, or output a histogram that depicts each words frequency. The user menu needed to loop until user entered in the exit value.
   
What did you do particularly well?
 - This program shows that I have greatly improved my OOP skills. I used classes effectively, and the code is very legible and organized.
 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
 - I would like to add a way to add in more than one file at a time, perhaps allow the user to select which files they wanted to process, then have the program work from those selections.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
 - I had never used c++ maps before, so I had to read the c++ documentation and learn how to use it properly.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
 - Maps seem like a very useful structure to use, and improving on my OOP skills are sure to improve every project I work on.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 - Paring down the classes to only what I needed, and testing a feature in the program then implementing the feature as a standalone function were key to allowing me to develop the program in a legible and organized way.
